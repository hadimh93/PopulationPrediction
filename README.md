Investigation of Economic and Social Factors Affecting Population Growth in Iran: An Econometric Approach
From the past, the simulation, prediction, and control of the population of a country have been of great importance for much macro decision-making. The researchers have applied different methods for simulation and estimate of the growth. Many factors are affecting the population of a country. In this article, we have studied the birth and mortality rate in Iran, using the multi-step regression method. In addition, various regression tests have been neglected on the model to achieve the best possible result and the least possible error. In the end, the best model with an accuracy of 98 will be proposed, indicating that increasing job opportunities and Declining housing prices have the most significant impact on population growth.
